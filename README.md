# dnstrike
A small set of DNS utilities in the form of a weaponized DNS resolver. Use cases: SSRF exploitation, playing with DNS, anything you want.

## Commands
 - `<ip>.bind` - resolves IPv4-like subdomain in the form of `%d-%d-%d-%d` to the IPv4 address, example: `1-1-1-1.bind.domain.tld` resolves to `1.1.1.1`
 - `random` - resolves to random IPv4 address, example: `random.domain.tld` returns a random IPv4 address
 - `<subdomain>.as.<ip>` - creates record to resolve subdomain name to the IPv4 address, example: `testname.as.1-1-1-1.domain.tld` resolves to `1.1.1.1`
 - `<subdomain>.lookup` - returns created on the previous step IPv4 record for the subdomain, example: `testname.lookup.domain.tld` resolves to `1.1.1.1`

See tests for more details.

Type: A, Name: ns1, Data: <machine (VPS) IP>
Type: A, Name: ns2, Data: <machine (VPS) IP>
Type: NS, Name: anything you want, Data: ns1.<domain.tld>
Type: NS, Name: anything you want, Data: ns2.<domain.tld>
```
